# A-Password-and-Least-Significant-Bit-Substitution-Based-Steganography-Technique-for-Image-Hiding-

This project work introduces an image steganography technique using text-based password that acts as the symmetric key of encryption and decryption. It contains two components, an encoder, and a decoder. An encoder takes a secret image that needs to be hidden inside another cover image. The Combined image is encrypted with an eight charactersâ€™ password. The starting position of the cover image from where the secret image starts to hide depends on the password. Then the (Least Significant Bit) LSB Substitution technique is used to hide the entire secret image inside the cover image. The decoder takes the encrypted image and the password to retrieve the secret image back.
